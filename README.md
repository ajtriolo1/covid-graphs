# Covid Graphs

Covid Graphs is a python based website designed to display COVID-19 statistics in an organized way. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was hard to find a place where I could view COVID trends for other states and countries. Data was all over the place, so I decided to create a website to display the data the I found most important.

This website allows the user to pick a country and/or state that they would like to view the statistics of.

Global data is recieved from Our World In Data, while state data is from Covid Tracking Project.

The website is hosted by pythonanywhere, and can be found at http://ajtriolo.pythonanywhere.com/.
